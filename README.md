# Workout-Tracker

*What is this?* This project is a web application designed to allow users to plan and track their fitness routines. The application allows users to add exercises to their routine, edit details such as the sets and repetitions, and track their progress by marking workouts as complete. Workouts are displayed in a list of "workout" objects, which can be edited or removed freely by the user.

This project also includes timing functionality, implementing a countdown timer for timed exercises such as running. Timed workouts and non-timed workouts are differentiated within the program, making it easy for the user to view and edit workouts of each type.

The site makes use of DOM event handlers and asynchronous methods such as setTimeout() to give the page dynamic and interactive behavior, displaying an ability to manipulate the DOM and work with events in JavaScript.
